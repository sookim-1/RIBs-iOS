# RIBs Tutorial 1: Creating a RIB

This project is the starting point for [tutorial 1](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-1) that will get you aquatinted with the RIBs architecture.

### Getting started

Install tooling, unless you've done so already:

```
<RIBs path>/ios/tooling/install-xcode-template.sh
```

Then, install pods for the tutorial:

```
gem install cocoapods # In case you don't have it
cd <RIBs path>/ios/tutorials/tutorial1
pod install
```

Then, open the TicTacToe.xcworkspace that was generated by `pod install` and follow the steps described in [tutorial 1](https://github.com/uber/RIBs/wiki/iOS-Tutorial-1) on the RIBs wiki.

**Warning**: If you encounter the following error during build execution:

`SnapKit Pod SDK does not contain 'libarclite' at the path '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/arc/libarclite_iphoneos.a'; try increasing the minimum deployment target`

-> Please change the Minimum Deployment Target for SnapKit in the Pods project to **9.0** under TARGETS.
